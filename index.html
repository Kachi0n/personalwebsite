                    <p>Hi, I’m Kachi Onyeador! I’m passionate about creating immersive, interactive experiences that combine technology, storytelling, and design. With a background in cognitive science, computer science, and theater, I bring a unique interdisciplinary approach to my work, blending creativity with technical innovation.</p>

                    <p>I’ve worked on projects ranging from adaptive storytelling in live shows to AI-driven solutions for education and well-being. My mission is to design experiences that not only captivate but also make a meaningful impact. I’m particularly fascinated by the emerging intersections of media psychology and politics, especially how new technologies shape our perceptions and behaviors in a rapidly changing world.</p>
                        
                    <p>When I’m not working, I’m diving into the world of full-dive VR and geeking out about decision-based and story-driven games. I’m a gamer at heart and love collecting video games and consoles—it’s one of my favorite ways to explore how storytelling evolves across platforms. Outside of gaming, I’m into hiking, tennis, and spending time with my mini goldendoodle, Obi. Lately, I’ve been learning Spanish and Igbo while traveling to new places—whether it’s day trips around California or adventures across the globe.</p>
                    
                    <p>Feel free to explore my work or reach out—I’d love to connect and talk about the future of interactive media, immersive storytelling, and the role of technology in our lives!</p>

Witnessing how local businesses rallied to support our cause inspired me to pitch the idea of EquiTea to our team, an app that connects users with inclusive restaurants aligned with their values and causes they want to support—whether it’s accessibility, LGBTQ+ acceptance, and more.</li>
